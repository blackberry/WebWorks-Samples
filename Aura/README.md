# Aura Sample Application

This sample demonstrates how to integrate HTML5, Accelerometer data and CSS3 into a BlackBerry WebWorks application for the BlackBerry Tablet OS. [Aura](http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Web-and-WebWorks-Development/Sample-Application-Demonstrating-HTML5-and-Accelerometer/ta-p/1150115) is the name of a proof-of-concept WebWorks application, [initially demonstrates at Mobile World Congress 2011](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH7NKhNyygw), that allows a user to select from a 4-day Weather forcast of Barcelona Spain, and interact with the application elements by physically moving the BlackBerry device.

## How to Build

To build the Aura sample application:

1. Click on the **Downloads** tab above.
2. Select **Download as zip** (Windows) or **Download as tar.gz** (Mac) and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder on your local machine named **Aura** e.g. **C:\Documents and Settings\User\WebWorks\Aura** (Windows) or **~/WebWorks/Aura** (Mac).
4. Open the downloaded ZIP file from step 2 and extract the contents **from inside the zipped Aura folder** to your local **Aura** folder from step 3.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the local **Aura** folder (e.g. **~/WebWorks/Aura/config.xml**).
5. Using the **[Ripple Mobile Emulator](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)** and the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Tablet OS](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)**, package the contents of your local **Aura** folder into a BlackBerry application.  Enter the project root settings field as the local folder created in step 3, and the archive name settings field as **Aura**.
