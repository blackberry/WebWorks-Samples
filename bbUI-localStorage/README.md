## How to Build

To build the Aura sample application:


1. Click on the Download Zip button above or the **Downloads** tab and save the .zip to your desktop.
2. Open the downloaded ZIP file and extract the contents from inside the zipped Aura folder to your PC. This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as config.xml, are correctly located at the top level of the local localStorage folder.
3. Package and sign using either the **[WebWorks command line tool](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download/sdk)** or the **[Ripple Mobile Emulator](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)** for Tablet OS or BlackBerry 10.
