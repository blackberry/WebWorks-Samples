		The information and examples in the localStorage bbUI app is provided to the world free of charge in the hopes that it will be used to help make better apps for the BlackBerry PlayBook and BB10 devices. This app will be updated as new ideas are thought of and time allows.<br>
		A big thanks to RIM and the bbUI.js team for creating the framework that made this app possible! If you haven't heard of bbUI, check it out at <a style="color: #0033cc; text-decoration:underline;" onclick="launchGit()">https://github.com/blackberry/bbUI.js</a>.

			OpenSourceBB is a team of individuals dedicated to creating a more excellent BlackBerry user experience. OpenSourceBB started out building free BlackBerry Hybrid OSes, and expanded into building themes and eventually into running a BlackBerry blog, which is currently located at <a style="color: #0033cc; text-decoration:underline;" onclick="launchOSBB()">www.OpenSourceBB.com</a>.

			<div data-bb-type="panel-header">OSBBx</div>
			As the members of OpenSourceBB learned more about BlackBerry development, and inspired by decisions made by RIM's developer relations team, some OSBB members felt a desire to create a place fostering open communication between RIM employees and BlackBerry devs. Eventually OSBB began communications with other developers and developer groups. These communications lead to the creation of OSBBx, a group of individuals dedicated to promoting BlackBerry and becoming better developers. If you're interested in joining the OSBBx community, or if you just want to see what we're all about, check it out at  <a style="color: #0033cc; text-decoration:underline;" onclick="launchOSBBx()">x.opensourcebb.com</a>.
