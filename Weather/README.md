## How to Build

To build this sample application:

1. Click on the **Downloads** button at the top right of this screen.
2. Select **Download.zip** and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder on your local machine named **weather** (e.g. **c:\webworks\weather**).
4. Open the downloaded ZIP file from step 2 and **extract the contents from inside the top level folder** to your new **weather** folder.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the **weather** folder (e.g. **c:\webworks\weather\config.xml**).
5. Using an achiving utility (e.g. WinZip or 7-zip), package the contents of your **c:\webworks\weather** folder into a ZIP archive named **weather.zip**.  This archive should have the application assets (not a folder containing the application assets) at its top level.
6. Using the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for Smartphones](https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/html5/download/sdk)**, package the **weather.zip** archive into a BlackBerry Tablet OS application using the following command line: **bbwp c:\webworks\weather\weather.zip**
